Here you can find the three codes that we use to manage the lock.

Add_fingerprint will allow you to add fingerprint with ID to the system. It's working with the serial system. It's up to 127 different fingerprints.

Delete_fingerprint will allow you to delete fingerprint with their ID through the Serial system.

The last program manage the lock (open, close, display on the oled screen, send email and update the Gsheet).
