# Project Title: Smart Lock
 **Description**: Our project name is Smart Lock. It will be a lock (for a door for example) that will work with a fingerprint system. 
 
For the cloud part, the access will be manage through a database and not directly in the Arduino card. 

It will allow us to modify permission with our interface that will probably be a web site. We will implement a door sensor that will allow us to know if someone open or close the door without using the fingerprint system. It will work like an alarm. If needed, it will send a notification.
