# Project Title: Smart Lock
 **Description**: Our project name is Smart Lock. It's a lock (for a door for example) that works with a fingerprint system.

The system works with an ESP 32 that is connected in Wifi to send data.

The fingerprint are memorize in the module AS 308 and we can manage them through 2 basics programs to add or delete fingerprint. 
We also have implemented a door sensor that allow us to know if someone open or close the door. When the door sensor is trigger it's send a mail to notify that the door is open. It's like a quite alarm. 
The fingerprint system simulates the outside of the house and a simple button simulates the inside of the house.
