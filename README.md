# Project Title: Smart Lock
 **Description**: Our project name is Smart Lock. It will be a lock (for a door for example) that will work with a fingerprint system. 
 
For the cloud part, the access will be manage trough a database and not directly in the Arduino card. 

It will allow us to modify permission with our interface that will probably be a web site. The plus that we imagine would be to implement a captor in the lock in order to create a “warning mode” that could be use when you go in holidays. 

It will simply send a notification when the door is open if you switch on this mode.
