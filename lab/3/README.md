# Lab Three

The aim of this TP was to use the OLED screen that we have. So, we finally manage to use an OLED screen with an arduino card by using the I2C protocol. We also manage to display 
the image that we want by using bitmap. We also success to display bitmap and text at the same time by playing with the size of each component.

## Issues
  
1. For this TP, the bigger issue we had, was to find the proper library to use the OLED screen because there are many of them. Then, with all examples that we have we didn't find
any big problem.
