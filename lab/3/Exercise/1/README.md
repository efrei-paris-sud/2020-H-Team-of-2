# Exercise 1

## Find I2C devices

In this question, the aim was to use the code that we have in the example to find the hexadecimal address of our OLED screen. The address was 0x3C. 

## Image of the circuit

Here you can see our circuit. We correctly wire the I2C cable by starting of A4 and A5 on this arduino card.
