# Lab One

This lab was a tutorial for the arduino kit starter. We simply learn how to use some of the components that we can find in an electronic circuit. To success this lab, we use  lessons from the documentation that the subject provided. At the end of this tutorial, we were able to understand all simple instructions and components of the kit. 

## Exercises
  - [Exercise 1](Exercise/1)
  - [Exercise 2](Exercise/2)
  - [Exercise 3](Exercise/3)
  - [Exercise 4](Exercise/4)
  - [Exercise 5](Exercise/5)
  - [Exercise 6](Exercise/6)
  - [Exercise 7](Exercise/7)
  
## Issues

1. The first issue that we encountered was to understand the port system on the arduino and the code. We were quickly able to understand but it was the first step.
2. The second issue was to reproduce the schema of the [Exercise 3](Exercise/3) because we though we need to use a led as previous exercise and not the led of the arduino card on the port 13. It's not really an issue, it's more like a new step that we add ourselves.
3. In the same exercise, the first time we forget to add the pinmode (for the button) so it wasn't working. We rapidly find the mistake.
4. For the [Exercise 6](Exercise/6), it take us some time to find the function noTone in order to stop the buzzer. Finally, we correctly manage it.
