# Lab Four

The objective of this TP was to communicate with other devices we the helps of a board that has WiFi, Bluetooth or etc. Therefore we will use ESP 32 board 
which is suitable for this usage. We use the same code as the TP 3 for exercices 1 & 2 but with ESP32.So, we finally manage to use a LED and an OLED screen by using the an ESP32

## Exercises

  - [Exercise 1](Exercise/1)
  - [Exercise 2](Exercise/2)
  - [Exercise 3](Exercise/3)
  
  
## Issues
  
1. For this TP, the bigger issue we had, was to display a bitmap on the OLED screen because we forgot and didn't know when the ESP32 is right connected to the OLED. The second issue is the same problem for the exercice 3, 
we didn't make the good embranchment with the potentiometer and forgot to read the analog values.
