# Lab Two

The aim of this lab was to use captor in order to realize the connected home presented in the TP1. It was also to discover a way of talking between devices, in this case I2C. We couldn't realize the practical part with all captors because we hadn't them.

## Issues

1. First, we had to discover how to discuss between to devices. It wasn't hard, but it was a discovery so made some tests.
2. The second issue was most a misunderstanding from us. We first tough that the pin for SDA and SCL was not specific pin that were created for. But when we look at the schema from the TP1, we understood our mistake.
3. The third issue was to understand properly how works I2C but specifically in the code. The theory was clear for us but not the code. In fact, we couldn't discover because we hadn't the proper material to realize some tests.
4. For the Fritzing part, the biggest part was to find the proper component to import because there is plenty of model on internet.
