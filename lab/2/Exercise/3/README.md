# Exercise 3

## Use temperature and humidity captors

This exercise was the first to uses I2C and captors at the same time. The aim of the question was to find the proper code to display the temperature and the humidity of the room
on the LCD screen.

Because we haven't the material (in this case the captors), we weren't not able to realize this question.
