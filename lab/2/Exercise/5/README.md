# Exercise 5

## Add another I2C device to the system

This question was the first of the Extra questions. We were supposed to add a new I2C device. This part was theorical because we should draw the system and adding a MPU 5060. You
can see below how it would work. 

## Schema with MPU 5060

In this schema, you can see that we have branched the ground, the VCC, the SDA and the SCL wires to the rights ports of the MPU.
